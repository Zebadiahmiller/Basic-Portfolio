            <p class="paragraph" id="p"> Hello, my name is Zebadiah Miller. I am currently employed at American Medical Response as an emergency paramedic. My job includes using many different skills
                in emergency patient management. I am who you get when you call 911. I enjoy playing video games, reading books, snowboarding, water skiing, and spending time
                with my wife and two dogs, Sid and Gus. I currently live in Gilbert Arizona in my first home that I recently purchased. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" id="p">I am changing careers because I am no longer enjoying what I do. I do not have the drive and passion that I had when I first started this career. When I 
                was younger this was the career I had always wanted but family talked me out of pursuing this as a career and convinced me to go into medicine. I am excited 
                and eager to learn and grow.
